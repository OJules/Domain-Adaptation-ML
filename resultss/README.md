## üéØ How to Generate Results

Run the main script to populate this directory:
```bash
python domain_adaptation_main.py
```

The analysis workflow:
1. **Source Domain Training** - Initial model development
2. **Domain Gap Analysis** - Distribution shift measurement
3. **Adaptation Process** - Feature alignment and transfer
4. **Target Domain Evaluation** - Performance assessment

## üìà Key Performance Indicators

Expected metrics include:
- **Source Accuracy** - Performance on original domain
- **Target Accuracy** - Performance after adaptation
- **Adaptation Gain** - Improvement from domain adaptation
- **Domain Distance** - Statistical measures of domain shift
